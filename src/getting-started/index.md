To learn what the heck this is all about, start at the [general introduction](introduction.md).

Before you can launch a TYPO3-on-AWS machine image, you need an account to use Amazon Web Services' (AWS) products/services. Follow the (external) links below to learn more about AWS and how to create an account in case you don't have one yet.

Once you have an account, you are ready to launch an [EC2 instance](../miscellaneous/glossary.md#ec2instance) with TYPO3 pre-installed and pre-configured. It only takes a few minutes and you will be able to access the instance and TYPO3 with full administrator privileges.
