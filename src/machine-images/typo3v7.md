## History

The TYPO3 v11.x machine images are available at the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-34xndlfjcq33i). We published the first TYPO3 v7 machine image in January 2015. Subsequent releases include all TYPO3 sprint releases including the long-term support version **TYPO3 v7 LTS** (also known as version 7.6).

TYPO3 CMS 7.x reached its end-of-life in December 2018. Extended support can be purchased from the [TYPO3 GmbH](https://typo3.com){.fa-icon .fa-right-external-link-alt}.

## TYPO3

According to the [official release announcement](https://typo3.org/article/announcing-typo3-cms-7-lts/){.fa-icon .fa-right-external-link-alt}, the highlights of TYPO3 version 7 LTS are:

* Restructured TYPO3 backend.
* Performance increase.
* Revised install tool.

The LTS-version was released on Tuesday, 10 November 2015. More than three years after the initial release, this version reached its end-of-life on Friday, 30 November 2018 (see [announcement](https://typo3.org/article/this-is-the-end-for-typo3-v7-lts/){.fa-icon .fa-right-external-link-alt}) and users were encouraged to upgrade to [TYPO3 v8](typo3v8.md).
