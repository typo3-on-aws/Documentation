We have created a number of machine images for a variety of TYPO3 versions over the last years. In fact, the first TYPO3 version that was publicly available at the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=3c5e5f3c-d60e-4405-a9ca-aae8abfa3e2b){.fa-icon .fa-right-external-link-alt} was version 6.2, published in 2013.

The following TYPO3 versions are currently available as ready-to-use [machine images](../miscellaneous/glossary.md#machineimages){.fa-icon .fa-right-glossary} at the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=3c5e5f3c-d60e-4405-a9ca-aae8abfa3e2b){.fa-icon .fa-right-external-link-alt}:
