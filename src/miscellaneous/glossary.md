### <a id="cloudfront">Amazon CloudFront</a>

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that aims to improve the performance, reliability, and availability of websites and applications. TYPO3 works well with Amazon CloudFront in general and the TYPO3-on-AWS machine images can be easily configured to store resources in the CDN nodes. See [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for further details.

### <a id="machineimages">Machine Image</a>

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are like a template of a computer's root drive. They contain the operating system and all components required to run the application. For the TYPO3-on-AWS machine images this could be a web server ([Apache](https://httpd.apache.org), [PHP](https://www.php.net/docs.php), possibly a database server, and all components required for a server).

### <a id="ec2instance">EC2 Instance</a>

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a service provided by AWS that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It enables you to launch and manage Linux/UNIX and Windows Server instances in Amazon's data centers. See [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) for further details.

### <a id="awsmarketplace">AWS Marketplace</a>

The AWS Marketplace is a catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors. Products listed on the Marketplace include solutions for infrastructure software, DevOps, Business Applications, Machine Learning, IoT, and many more areas. Search for [TYPO3](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=typo3) to list all available TYPO3-related products or click the following link to list the "TYPO3-on-AWS" machine images: [TYPO3-on-AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=3c5e5f3c-d60e-4405-a9ca-aae8abfa3e2b)

### <a id="amazonrds">Amazon RDS</a>

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) aims to make it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Amazon RDS can be used for TYPO3-on-AWS when the database should be stored decentralized and not on the same server as the TYPO3 instance for example. Amazon RDS offers database engines such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and SQL Server. See [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds) for further details.

We also have great experience with TYPO3 and [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) (which is in fact the MariaDB engine).
